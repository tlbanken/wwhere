Weather Where: The weather guessing game.

This is a simple game in which you try to guess the city that matches the given weather conditions. This project is meant for me to practice working with APIs in GO.

## What you need
- `Golang`
- `OpenWeatherMap api key`
- `Linux/OSX`

## Running
1. Run the `set_api_keys.py` script to set your API key from openweathermap (only need to do this once)
2. `go run cmd/wwhere/main.go`
3. The game will run forever, use CTRL-C to stop.
